# Chip 8 Interpreter

## Welcome

Welcome and thanks for checking out the project! This started out as a pet project for me to learn about emulators. Never would've thought anyone would be interested at all so it's great to have anyone contribute.

## Testing

Currently I have some unit tests for each instruction in Chip8 set. These are located in the HJM.Chip8.CPU.Tests project. You can run these (and any future tests) using Visual Studio or with the following command from the root directory:

    dotnet test HJM.Chip8/HJM.Chip8.sln

## Style guide

Currently we do not have a set of style guidelines, try to keep it similar to the code around it. I'm thinking about implementing StyleCop if I do that it will be the style guide for me :)
